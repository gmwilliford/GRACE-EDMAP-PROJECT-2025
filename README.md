Single-Aquifer GRACE derived GWS anomaly (R ≥ 4.x )

Modular R workflow to process one aquifer: trains an RF model on GRACE + GLDAS,
Applies residual correction at 0.25°, 
Computes GWS anomalies, and 
Validates against valid well logs (smoothing, clustering, and cluster-level lag alignment). 
Visualizes maps, stats, and figures.
